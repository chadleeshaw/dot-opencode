# dot-opencode

OpenCode AI configuration — agents, commands, skills, plugins, and scripts.

Cloned to `~/.agents` and symlinked into `~/.config/opencode` by `setup.sh`.

## Structure

```
~/.agents/
├── agents/       # Custom agent definitions
├── commands/     # Slash commands (/shipit, /test, ...)
├── skills/       # Language/domain skills loaded on demand
├── plugins/      # OpenCode JS plugins
├── scripts/      # CLI tools (oc-swarm, oc-worker)
└── setup.sh      # Idempotent install script
```

## Setup

```sh
git clone git@github.com:chadleeshaw/dot-opencode.git ~/.agents
~/.agents/setup.sh
```

`setup.sh` symlinks everything into place and adds scripts to `~/.local/bin`. Safe to re-run.

## Agents

Custom agents in `agents/` extend OpenCode's built-in agent types.

| Agent | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `architect` | Analyze and improve workflows, processes, and system design |
| `bug-finder` | Identify logic errors and potential issues |
| `code-review` | Code review focused on readability and security |
| `documentation` | Write clear, concise README and docs files |
| `optimizer` | Analyze runtime performance and identify bottlenecks |
| `refactor` | Improve readability and maintainability |
| `test-coverage` | Audit tests for coverage gaps and quality issues |
| `test-writer` | Write readable, maintainable tests for existing code |
| `gsd-*` | GSD orchestration suite — plan, execute, verify, debug phases |

## Commands

Slash commands in `commands/` are available inside any OpenCode session.

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/shipit` | Stage, commit, and push changes with an auto-generated message |
| `/test` | Run tests and fix failures |

## Skills

Skills in `skills/` are loaded on demand when a task matches their domain.

| Skill | Loaded for |
|---|---|
| `golang` | Go best practices |
| `javascript` | JS/TS best practices |
| `python` | Python best practices |
| `css` | CSS best practices |
| `html` | HTML best practices |
| `obsidian` | Obsidian notes and knowledge management |

## Plugins

| Plugin | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `cmux-notify.js` | Sends a cmux notification ring when OpenCode goes idle or errors |

## Scripts

Scripts in `scripts/` are symlinked to `~/.local/bin` by `setup.sh`.

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `oc-swarm` | Orchestrate parallel OpenCode sessions in cmux workspaces |
| `oc-worker` | Worker process spawned by `oc-swarm` inside each workspace |

### oc-swarm

Run multiple OpenCode agents in parallel, each in its own cmux workspace:

```sh
# Launch workers for two tasks
oc-swarm --task "fix the auth bug" --task "refactor UI components"

# Name the workers
oc-swarm --name auth --task "audit auth flow" --name ui --task "clean components"

# Monitor progress
oc-swarm --watch

# View results
oc-swarm --results
```
